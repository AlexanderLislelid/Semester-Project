        Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we're committed to
        making science accessible to all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
        understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything
        from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience
        the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong
        passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
      </p>

        Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 'The Sky
        Above Us', explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the
        universe around us.

        Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know
        today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few
        of the creatures who didn't survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the
        Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

      <p>
        The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
        intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
        applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here.
        You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.
