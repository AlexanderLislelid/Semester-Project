          Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we're committed to
          making science accessible to all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
          understanding of <span class="fire">Fire</span>,
          <span class="wind">Wind</span>, <span class="water">Water</span>, and
          <span class="earth">Earth</span> to exploring everything from galaxies
          far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
          experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
          lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.

            It is our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the
            Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be delivering 3 lectures
            on the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in this

            On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
            exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It's a series
            of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
            elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
            'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are able to use and control
            wind to create power.
