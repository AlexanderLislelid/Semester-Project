      <p>
        Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we're committed to
        making science accessible to all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
        understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything
        from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience
        the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong
        passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 'The Sky
        Above Us', explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the
        universe around us.

      <p>
        Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know
        today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few
        of the creatures who didn't survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the
        Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

      <p>
        The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
        intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
        applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here.
        You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.
      </p>

      <h2>special events</h2>
      <h3>night at the museum</h3>
      <p>
        Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you
        sleep over beside dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your own
        sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we go exploring the wonders of
        science.
      </p>
      <h3>visiting professor of aeronautics</h3>
      <p>
        It is our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the
        Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be delivering 3 lectures on
        the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in this
        exciting 'space'.
      </p>
      <h3>energetica exhibition</h3>
      <p>
        On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
        exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It's a series of
        installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
        elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
        'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind
        to create power.

      <h3>holiday clubs</h3>
      <p>
        During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can
        join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each
        holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the
        holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.
      </p>
      <h3>young stars club</h3>
      <p>
        We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday
